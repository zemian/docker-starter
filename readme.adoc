Docker unlocks the potential of your organization by giving developers and IT the freedom to build, manage and secure business-critical applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in.

== Getting Started on Windows 10

IMPORTANT: The Docker for Windows will disable VirtualBox that you have installed on the system! You can only run one and not the other! If you want both, you may want to create a Linux VM then install Docker under that VM.

You would need elevated Admin Rights to run!

1. Download "Docker For Windows.exe". (You need an account)
from https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

2. Run `cmd.exe` (As Administrator)

	docker version
	docker run hello-world
	docker run -it ubuntu bash

NOTE: If installed as separated admin account, you need to run the "Docker For Windows" program with "As Administrator".
